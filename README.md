# THUG SDL

A mod to improve the gameplay experience of the PC version of Tony Hawk's Underground. It adds stability and usability fixes, utilizes the SDL2 game library and offers an open base for script-mod development.

## How to install

Download the latest version from the relase tab and extract the files from the zip-archive into the game directory.<br>
 - Default game directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Tony Hawk's Underground\Game`

Run `thugsdlpatcher.exe` in the Game directory where THUG.exe should already be. It will generate THUG-SDL.exe which will be used to start the game from now on. This only needs to be done once.<br>There is also a brief [video](https://youtu.be/717bshkWhMw) showcasing the process.<br><br>*Important: This only works for the No-CD THUG.exe, which is approximately 2.6 MB in size.*

## MODLOADER
This allows you to load user-defined `.pre` and `.qb` files from a separate folder. 
Activate "Additional Mods" in the launcher's General Page and define your folder path relative to the game folder: `data/pre/mymod`.
- Place mod contents inside your mod folder at `C:\<thug-install-path>\Game\Data\pre\mymod`  
- Create a `mod.ini` file in that folder (it defines which original files you want to replace with your custom ones)

**THUG-SDL uses its own script mods by default. Select "Disable Script Mods" in the launcher or your changes could get overwritten!**<br><br>

Example mod.ini:
```
[MODINFO]
Name=My Custom Mod

[PRE]
qb.pre=modded_qb.pre
anims.pre=modded_anims.pre
netanims.pre=modded_netanims.pre

[QB]
scripts\game\skater\airtricks.qb=modded_airtricks.qb
scripts\game\skater\manualtricks.qb=modded_manualtricks.qb
levels\mainmenu\mainmenu_scripts.qb=modded_mainmenu_scripts.qb
```
The folder contents should look like this:

### Levels
Level files cannot be loaded automatically from the mod folder without adjusting the `load_level` script.<br>
There need to be additional checks for a "custom_folder" parameter, see the example file here: [Levels.q](https://github.com/atljp/THUG-SDL/blob/main/src/Mod/Levels.q)<br><br>
When creating the level struct, add the paths and the "custom_folder" parameter like this:
```
File: scripts\Game\Levels.q

Level_AU = { 
	 pre = "mymod\\Levels\\AU.pre"
	 scnpre = "mymod\\Levels\\AUscn.pre"
	 colpre = "mymod\\Levels\\AUcol.pre"
	 pedpre = "mymod\\Levels\\AUped.pre"
	 [...]
	 custom_folder = "mymod\\Levels\\"
}
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issues with write permissions

The game settings are stored in `thugsdl.ini` which needs write permission when you change and save settings. <br>

If the directory your game is installed to is protected, e.g. Program Files (x86), the ini file needs to be located in  
`C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore`. <br>The game will use the VirtualStore location to load and save settings.

### Gamepad bindings and controls

The control settings in the launcher expect the default gamepad binds. When you change to a non-default setup and want to change the controls, you have to account for the bind changes.<br>
Example 1:
- Default Ps2 layout: Spin left on L1, Spin right on R1. Nollie on L2, Switch/Revert on R2
- - In your custom binds you want to swap L1 <-> L2 and R1 <-> R2. This can be done directly in the "Gamepad" tab in the launcher
- - When you want to set the Caveman key to be on the L1 key, you would have to select L2 in the "Controls" tab in the launcher

Example 2:
- Default Xbox layout: Spin left and Nollie on L2, Spin Right and Revert on R2, Caveman on either L1 or R1
- - In your custom binds you want Spin left and Nollie on L1, Spin right and revert on L2, Caveman on R1 and Dropdown on R2.
- - In the "Gamepad" tab in the launcher, set Spin left on L1, Spin right on L2, Caveman on R2
- - In the "Controls" tab in the launcher, set Caveman to R1 and Drop down to L1 (you moved the default bind from L1 to R2 so it will apply R2). The controls tab only knows about the default binds.

## BUILDING FROM SOURCE

### Prerequisites
The build requires the following tools:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [Recommended: git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

First download and install Visual Studio and CMake like any other GUI application.<br>
Install git via the Installer from the website or directly in Powershell:
- `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

Then install vcpkg via git as described in the Microsoft documentation:
- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`
- Run the bootstrap script `cd vcpkg && .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

Install SDL2 via vcpkg: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2:x86-windows`, for x64: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2`

### Generating the project file
Create a THUG-SDL/build directory. Then build the VS Solution with CMake from that directory via Powershell:
```
cmake .. -A win32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/[vcpkg directory]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
Set the optimization for the DLL to O0 (disable optimization) because MSVC seems to break certain functions when optimization is enabled.
<br><br>
The `.sln` file is in the `build` directory. Make sure to select win32 and Release as the project's build options in Visual Studio. Build the actual DLL with `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
<br><br>
When building the launcher, make sure to set the SubSystem to Windows. In Visual Studio go to the project properties, Linker, System.
