# THUG SDL

A mod to improve the gameplay experience of the PC version of Tony Hawk's Underground. It adds stability and usability fixes, utilizes the SDL2 game library and offers an open base for script-mod development.

## How to install

Download the latest version from the relase tab and extract the files from the zip-archive into the game directory.<br>
Running any THUG.exe (except THUGONE.exe from Clownjob'd) will automatically load the mod from d3d9.dll.
 - Default game directory: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Tony Hawk's Underground\Game`

### Issues with write permissions

`thugsdl.ini` is the settings-database and needs write permission for storing window positions. <br>
If your game is installed at `C:\Program Files (x86)`, the ini and savegame files have to be located in:
- C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore

## BUILDING

### Prerequisites
The build requires the following tools:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- [Recommended: git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

First download and install Visual Studio and CMake like any other GUI application.<br>
Install git via the Installer from the website or directly in Powershell:
- `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`

Then install vcpkg via git as described in the Microsoft documentation:
- `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git`
- Run the bootstrap script `cd vcpkg && .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

Install SDL2 via vcpkg: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2:x86-windows`, for x64: `.\vcpkg.exe install SDL2`

### Generating the project file
Create a thug2-sdl/build directory. Then build the VS Solution with CMake from that directory via Powershell:
```
cmake .. -A win32 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/[vcpkg directory]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
Set the optimization for the partymod dll to O0 (disable optimization) because MSVC seems to break certain functions when optimization is enabled.
<br><br>
The `.sln` file is in the `build` directory. Make sure to select win32 and Release as the project's build options in Visual Studio. Build the actual DLL with `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
